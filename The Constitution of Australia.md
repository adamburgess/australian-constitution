## An Act to constitute the Commonwealth of Australia.

WHEREAS the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia,
Queensland, and Tasmania, humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty
God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under
the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and under
the Constitution hereby established:

And whereas it is expedient to provide for the admission into the
Commonwealth of other Australasian Colonies and possessions of the
Queen:

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and
with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and
Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of
the same, as follows:—

#### 1. Short title.

This Act may be cited as the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act.

#### 2. Act to extend to the Queen's successors.

The provisions of this Act referring to the Queen shall extend to Her
Majesty's heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.

#### 3. Proclamation of Commonwealth.

It shall be lawful for the Queen, with the advice of the Privy Council,
to declare by proclamation that, on and after a day therein appointed,
not being later than one year after the passing of this Act, the people
of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania,
and also, if Her Majesty is satisfied that the people of Western
Australia have agreed thereto, of Western Australia, shall be united in
a Federal Commonwealth under the name of the Commonwealth of Australia.
But the Queen may, at any time after the proclamation, appoint a
Governor‑General for the Commonwealth.

#### 4. Commencement of Act.

The Commonwealth shall be established, and the Constitution of the
Commonwealth shall take effect, on and after the day so appointed. But
the Parliaments of the several colonies may at any time after the
passing of this Act make any such laws, to come into operation on the
day so appointed, as they might have made if the Constitution had taken
effect at the passing of this Act.

#### 5. Operation of the Constitution and laws.

This Act, and all laws made by the Parliament of the Commonwealth under
the Constitution, shall be binding on the courts, judges, and people of
every State and of every part of the Commonwealth, notwithstanding
anything in the laws of any State; and the laws of the Commonwealth
shall be in force on all British ships, the Queen's ships of war
excepted, whose first port of clearance and whose port of destination
are in the Commonwealth.

#### 6. Definitions.

"The Commonwealth" shall mean the Commonwealth of Australia as
established under this Act.

"The States" shall mean such of the colonies of New South Wales, New
Zealand, Queensland, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia, and South
Australia, including the northern territory of South Australia, as for
the time being are parts of the Commonwealth, and such colonies or
territories as may be admitted into or established by the Commonwealth
as States; and each of such parts of the Commonwealth shall be called "a
State."

"Original States" shall mean such States as are parts of the
Commonwealth at its establishment.

#### 7. Repeal of Federal Council Act.

The Federal Council of Australasia Act, 1885, is hereby repealed, but so
as not to affect any laws passed by the Federal Council of Australasia
and in force at the establishment of the Commonwealth.

Any such law may be repealed as to any State by the Parliament of the
Commonwealth, or as to any colony not being a State by the Parliament
thereof.

#### 8. Application of Colonial Boundaries Act.

After the passing of this Act the Colonial Boundaries Act, 1895, shall
not apply to any colony which becomes a State of the Commonwealth; but
the Commonwealth shall be taken to be a self‑governing colony for the
purposes of that Act.

#### 9. Constitution.

The Constitution of the Commonwealth shall be as follows:—

##### The Constitution.

This Constitution is divided as follows:—

* Chapter I. The Parliament:
  * Part I. General:

  * Part III. The House of Representatives:

## Chapter I.—The Parliament.

### Part I.—General.

#### 1. Legislative Power.

The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal
Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of
Representatives, and which is hereinafter called "The Parliament," or
"The Parliament of the Commonwealth."

#### 2. Governor-General.

A Governor-General appointed by the Queen shall be Her Majesty's
representative in the Commonwealth, and shall have and may exercise in
the Commonwealth during the Queen's pleasure, but subject to this
Constitution, such powers and functions of the Queen as her Majesty may
be pleased to assign to him.

#### 3. Salary of Governor-General.

There shall be payable to the Queen out of the Consolidated Revenue fund
of the Commonwealth, for the salary of the Governor-General, and annual
sum which, until the Parliament otherwise provides, shall be ten
thousand pounds.

The salary of a Governor-General shall not be altered during his
continuance in office.

#### 4. Provisions relating to Governor-General.

The provisions of this Constitution relating to the Governor‑General
extend and apply to the Governor‑General for the time being, or such
person as the Queen may appoint to administer the Government of the
Commonwealth; but no such person shall be entitled to receive any salary
from the Commonwealth in respect of any other office during his
administration of the Government of the Commonwealth.

#### 5. Sessions of Parliament.

Prorogation and Dissolution.

The Governor-General may appoint such times for holding the sessions of
the Parliament as he thinks fit, and may also from time to time, by
Proclamation or otherwise, prorogue the Parliament, and may in like
manner dissolve the House of Representatives.

Summoning Parliament.

After any general election the Parliament shall be summoned to meet not
later than thirty days after the day appointed for the return of the
writs.

First session.

The Parliament shall be summoned to meet not later than six months after
the establishment of the Commonwealth.

#### 6. Yearly session of Parliament.

There shall be a session of the Parliament once at least in every year,
so that twelve months shall not intervene between the last sitting of
the Parliament in one session and its first sitting in the next session.

### Part II.—The Senate.

#### 7. The Senate.

The Senate shall be composed of senators for each State, directly chosen
by the people of the State, voting, until the Parliament otherwise
provides, as one electorate.

But until the Parliament of the Commonwealth otherwise provides, the
Parliament of the State of Queensland, if that State be an Original
State, may make laws dividing the State into divisions and determining
the number of senators to be chosen for each division, and in the
absence of such provision the State shall be one electorate.

Until the Parliament otherwise provides there shall be six senators for
each Original State. The Parliament may make laws increasing or
diminishing the number of senators for each State, but so that equal
representation of the several Original States shall be maintained and
that no Original State shall have less than six senators.

The senators shall be chosen for a term of six years, and the names of
the senators chosen for each State shall be certified by the Governor to
the Governor-General.

#### 8. Qualification of electors.

The qualification of electors of senators shall be in each State that
which is prescribed by this Constitution, or by the Parliament, as the
qualification for electors of members of the House of Representatives;
but in the choosing of senators each elector shall vote only once.

#### 9. Method of election of senators.

The Parliament of the Commonwealth may make laws prescribing the method
of choosing senators, but so that the method shall be uniform for all
the States. Subject to any such law, the Parliament of each State may
make laws prescribing the method of choosing the senators for that
State.

Times and places.

The Parliament of a State may make laws for determining the times and
places of elections of senators for the State.

#### 10. Application of State laws.

Until the Parliament otherwise provides, but subject to this
Constitution, the laws in force in each State, for the time being,
relating to elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of
the State shall, as nearly as practicable, apply to elections of
senators for the State.

#### 11. Failure to choose senators.

The Senate may proceed to the despatch of business, notwithstanding the
failure of any State to provide for its representation in the Senate.

#### 12. Issue of writs.

The Governor of any State may cause writs to be issued for elections of
senators for the State. In case of the dissolution of the Senate the
writs shall be issued within ten days from the proclamation of such
dissolution.

#### 13. Rotation of senators.

As soon as may be after the Senate first meets, and after each first
meeting of the Senate following a dissolution thereof, the Senate shall
divide the senators chosen for each State into two classes, as nearly
equal in number as practicable; and the places of the senators of the
first class shall become vacant at the expiration of three years, and
the places of those of the second class at the expiration of six years,
from the beginning of their term of service; and afterwards the places
of senators shall become vacant at the expiration of six years from the
beginning of their term of service.

The election to fill vacant places shall be made within one year before
the places are to become vacant.

For the purposes of this section the term of service of a senator shall
be taken to begin on the first day of July following the day of his
election, except in the cases of the first election and of the election
next after any dissolution of the Senate, when it shall be taken to
begin on the first day of July preceding the day of his election.

#### 14. Further provision for rotation.

Whenever the number of senators for a State is increased or diminished,
the Parliament of the Commonwealth may make such provision for the
vacating of the places of senators for the State as it deems necessary
to maintain regularity in the rotation.

#### 15. Casual vacancies.

If the place of a senator becomes vacant before the expiration of his term of 
service, the Houses of Parliament of the State for which he was chosen, sitting 
and voting together, or, if there is only one House of that Parliament, that 
House, shall choose a person to hold the place until the expiration of the 
term. But if the Parliament of the State is not in session when the vacancy is 
notified, the Governor of the State, with the advice of the Executive Council 
thereof, may appoint a person to hold the place until the expiration of 
fourteen days from the beginning of the next session of the Parliament of the 
State or the expiration of the term, whichever first happens.

Where a vacancy has at any time occurred in the place of a senator chosen by 
the people of a State and, at the time when he was so chosen, he was publicly 
recognized by a particular political party as being an endorsed candidate of 
that party and publicly represented himself to be such a candidate, a person 
chosen or appointed under this section in consequence of that vacancy, or in 
consequence of that vacancy and a subsequent vacancy or vacancies, shall, 
unless there is no member of that party available to be chosen or appointed, be 
a member of that party.

Where—

(a)  in accordance with the last preceding paragraph, a member of a particular 
political party is chosen or appointed to hold the place of a senator whose 
place had become vacant; and

(b)  before taking his seat he ceases to be a member of that party (otherwise 
than by reason of the party having ceased to exist),

he shall be deemed not to have been so chosen or appointed and the vacancy 
shall be again notified in accordance with section twenty-one of this 
Constitution.

The name of any senator chosen or appointed under this section shall be 
certified by the Governor of the State to the Governor-General.

If the place of a senator chosen by the people of a State at the election of 
senators last held before the commencement of the Constitution Alteration 
(Senate Casual Vacancies) 1977 became vacant before that commencement and, at 
that commencement, no person chosen by the House or Houses of Parliament of the 
State, or appointed by the Governor of the State, in consequence of that 
vacancy, or in consequence of that vacancy and a subsequent vacancy or 
vacancies, held office, this section applies as if the place of the senator 
chosen by the people of the State had become vacant after that commencement.

A senator holding office at the commencement of the Constitution Alteration 
(Senate Casual Vacancies) 1977, being a senator appointed by the Governor of a 
State in consequence of a vacancy that had at any time occurred in the place of 
a senator chosen by the people of the State, shall be deemed to have been 
appointed to hold the place until the expiration of fourteen days after the 
beginning of the next session of the Parliament of the State that commenced or 
commences after he was appointed and further action under this section shall be 
taken as if the vacancy in the place of the senator chosen by the people of the 
State had occurred after that commencement.

Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, a senator holding office at the 
commencement of the Constitution Alteration (Senate Casual Vacancies) 1977 who 
was chosen by the House or Houses of Parliament of a State in consequence of a 
vacancy that had at any time occurred in the place of a senator chosen by the 
people of the State shall be deemed to have been chosen to hold office until 
the expiration of the term of service of the senator elected by the people of 
the State.

If, at or before the commencement of the Constitution Alteration (Senate Casual 
Vacancies) 1977, a law to alter the Constitution entitled "Constitution 
Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) 1977" came into operation, a senator 
holding office at the commencement of that law who was chosen by the House or 
Houses of Parliament of a State in consequence of a vacancy that had at any 
time occurred in the place of a senator chosen by the people of a State shall 
be deemed to have been chosen to hold office—

(a)  if the senator elected by the people of the State had a term of service 
expiring on the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and

thereon; and the revenue of the Commonwealth shall in the first instance
be applied to the payment of the expenditure of the Commonwealth.

#### 83. Money to be appropriated by law.

No money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealth except
under appropriation made by law.

But until the expiration of one month after the first meeting of the
Parliament the Governor-General in Council may draw from the Treasury
and expend such moneys as may be necessary for the maintenance of any
department transferred to the Commonwealth and for the holding of the
first elections for the Parliament.

#### 84. Transfer of officers.

When any department of the public service of a State becomes transferred
to the Commonwealth, all officers of the department shall become subject
to the control of the Executive Government of the Commonwealth.

Any such officer who is not retained in the service of the Commonwealth
shall, unless he is appointed to some other office of equal emolument in
the public service of the State, be entitled to receive from the State
any pension, gratuity, or other compensation, payable under the law of
the State on the abolition of his office.

Any such officer who is retained in the service of the Commonwealth
shall preserve all his existing and accruing rights, and shall be
entitled to retire from office at the time, and on the pension or
retiring allowance, which would be permitted by the law of the State if
his service with the Commonwealth were a continuation of his service
with the State. Such pension or retiring allowance shall be paid to him
by the Commonwealth; but the State shall pay to the Commonwealth a part
thereof, to be calculated on the proportion which his term of service
with the State bears to his whole term of service, and for the purpose
of the calculation his salary shall be taken to be that paid to him by
the State at the time of the transfer.

Any officer who is, at the establishment of the Commonwealth, in the
public service of the State, and who is, by consent of the Governor of
the State with the advice of the Executive Council thereof, transferred
to the public service of the Commonwealth, shall have the same rights as
if he had been an officer of a department transferred to the
Commonwealth and were retained in the service of the Commonwealth.

#### 85. Transfer of property of State.

When any department of the public service of a State is transferred to
the Commonwealth—

(i.) All property of the State of any kind, used exclusively in
connexion with the department, shall become vested in the Commonwealth;
but, in the case of the departments controlling customs and excise and
bounties, for such time only as the Governor-General in Council may
declare to be necessary:

(ii.) The Commonwealth may acquire any property of the State, of any
kind used, but not exclusively used in connexion with the department;
the value thereof shall, if no agreement can be made, be ascertained in,
as nearly as may be, the manner in which the value of land, or of an
interest in land, taken by the State for public purposes is ascertained
under the law of the State in force at the establishment of the
Commonwealth:

(iii.) The Commonwealth shall compensate the State for the value of any
property passing to the Commonwealth under this section; if no agreement
can be made as to the mode of compensation, it shall be determined under
laws to be made by the Parliament:

(iv.) The Commonwealth shall, at the date of the transfer, assume the
current obligations of the State in respect of the department
transferred.

#### 86.

On the establishment of the Commonwealth, the collection and control of
duties of customs and of excise, and the control of the payment of
bounties, shall pass to the Executive Government of the Commonwealth.

#### 87.

During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth
and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, of the net
revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of customs and of excise not
more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth
towards its expenditure.

The balance shall, in accordance with this Constitution, be paid to the
several States, or applied towards the payment of interest on debts of
the several States taken over by the Commonwealth.

#### 88. Uniform duties of customs.

Uniform duties of customs shall be imposed within two years after the
establishment of the Commonwealth.

#### 89. Payment to States before uniform duties.

Until the imposition of uniform duties of customs—

(i.) The Commonwealth shall credit to each State the revenues collected
therein by the Commonwealth.

(ii.) The Commonwealth shall debit to each State—

*(a)* The expenditure therein of the Commonwealth incurred solely for
the maintenance or continuance, as at the time of transfer, of any
department transferred from the State to the Commonwealth;

\(b\) The proportion of the State, according to the number of its
people, in the other expenditure of the Commonwealth.

(iii.) The Commonwealth shall pay to each State month by month the
balance (if any) in favour of the State.

#### 90. Exclusive power over customs, excise, and bounties.

On the imposition of uniform duties of customs the power of the
Parliament to impose duties of customs and of excise, and to grant
bounties on the production or export of goods, shall become exclusive.

On the imposition of uniform duties of customs all laws of the several
States imposing duties of customs or of excise, or offering bounties on
the production or export of goods, shall cease to have effect, but any
grant of or agreement for any such bounty lawfully made by or under the
authority of the Government of any State shall be taken to be good if
made before the thirtieth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and
ninety-eight, and not otherwise.

#### 91. Exceptions as to bounties.

Nothing in this Constitution prohibits a State from granting any aid to
or bounty on mining for gold, silver, or other metals, nor from
granting, with the consent of both Houses of the Parliament of the
Commonwealth expressed by resolution, any aid to or bounty on the
production or export of goods.

#### 92. Trade within the Commonwealth to be free.

On the imposition of uniform duties of customs, trade, commerce, and
intercourse among the States, whether by means of internal carriage or
ocean navigation, shall be absolutely free.

But notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, goods imported before
the imposition of uniform duties of customs into any State, or into any
Colony which, whilst the goods remain therein, becomes a State, shall,
on thence passing into another State within two years after the
imposition of such duties, be liable to any duty chargeable on the
importation of such goods into the Commonwealth, less any duty paid in
respect of the goods on their importation.

#### 93. Payment to States for five years after uniform Tariffs.

During the first five years after the imposition of uniform duties of
customs, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides—

(i.) The duties of customs chargeable on goods imported into a State and
afterwards passing into another State for consumption, and the duties of
excise paid on goods produced or manufactured in a State and afterwards
passing into another State for consumption, shall be taken to have been
collected not in the former but in the latter State:

(ii.) Subject to the last subsection, the Commonwealth shall credit
revenue, debit expenditure, and pay balances to the several States as
prescribed for the period preceding the imposition of uniform duties of
customs.

#### 94. Distribution of surplus.

After five years from the imposition of uniform duties of customs, the
Parliament may provide, on such basis as it deems fair, for the monthly
payment to the several State of all surplus revenue of the Commonwealth.

#### 95. Customs duties of Western Australia.

Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the Parliament of the
State of Western Australia, if that State be an Original State, may,
during the first five years after the imposition of uniform duties of
customs, impose duties of customs on goods passing into that State and
not originally imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth; and
such duties shall be collected by the Commonwealth.

But any duty so imposed on any goods shall not exceed during the first
of such years the duty chargeable on the goods under the law of Western
Australia in force at the imposition of uniform duties, and shall not
exceed during the second, third, fourth, and fifth of such years
respectively, four-fifths, three-fifths, two-fifths, and one-fifth of
such latter duty, and all duties imposed under this section shall cease
at the expiration of the fifth year after the imposition of uniform
duties.

If at any time during the five years the duty on any goods under this
section is higher than the duty imposed by the Commonwealth on the
importation of the like goods, then such higher duty shall be collected
on the goods when imported into Western Australia from beyond the limits
of the Commonwealth.

#### 96. Financial assistance to States.

During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth
and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, the Parliament
may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions
as the Parliament thinks fit.

#### 97. Audit.

Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the laws in force in any Colony
which has become or becomes a State with respect to the receipt of
revenue and the expenditure of money on account of the Government of the
Colony, and the review and audit of such receipt and expenditure, shall
apply to the receipt of revenue and the expenditure of money on account
of the Commonwealth in the State in the same manner as if the
Commonwealth, or the Government or an officer of the Commonwealth, were
mentioned whenever the Colony, or the Government or an officer of the
Colony, is mentioned.

#### 98. Trade and commerce includes navigation and State railways.

The power of the Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and
commerce extends to navigation and shipping, and to railways the
property of any State.

#### 99. Commonwealth not to give preference.

The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce,
or revenue, give preference to one State or any part thereof over
another State or any part thereof.

#### 100. Nor abridge right to use water.

The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade or
commerce, abridge the right of a State or of the residents therein to
the reasonable use of the waters of rivers for conservation or
irrigation.

#### 101. Inter-State Commission.

There shall be an Inter-State Commission, with such powers of
adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for
the execution and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the
provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and of
all laws made thereunder.

#### 102. Parliament may forbid preferences by State.

The Parliament may by any law with respect to trade or commerce forbid,
as to railways, any preference or discrimination by any State, or by any
authority constituted under a State, if such preference or
discrimination is undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State; due
regard being had to the financial responsibilities incurred by any State
in connexion with the construction and maintenance of its railways. But
no preference or discrimination shall, within the meaning of this
section, be taken to be undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State,
unless so adjudged by the Inter-State Commission.

#### 103. Commissioners' appointment, tenure, and remuneration.

The members of the Inter-State Commission—

(i.) Shall be appointed by the Governor-General in Council:

(ii.) Shall hold office for seven years, but may be removed within that
time by the Governor-General in Council, on an address from both Houses
of the Parliament in the same session praying for such removal on the
ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity:

(iii.) Shall receive such remuneration as the Parliament may fix; but
such remuneration shall not be diminished during their continuance in
office.

#### 104. Saving of certain rates.

Nothing in this Constitution shall render unlawful any rate for the
carriage of goods upon a railway, the property of a State, if the rate
is deemed by the Inter-State Commission to be necessary for the
development of the territory of the State, and if the rate applies
equally to goods within the State and to goods passing into the State
from other States.

#### 105. Taking over public debts of States.

The Parliament may take over from the States their public debts, or a proportion
thereof according to the respective numbers of their people as shown by
the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, and may convert, renew, or
consolidate such debts, or any part thereof; and the States shall
indemnify the Commonwealth in respect of the debts taken over, and
thereafter the interest payable in respect of the debts shall be
deducted and retained from the portions of the surplus revenue of the
Commonwealth payable to the several States, or if such surplus is
insufficient, or if there is no surplus, then the deficiency or the
whole amount shall be paid by the several States.

  upon the Commonwealth and the States parties thereto notwithstanding anything 
  contained in this Constitution or the Constitution of the several States or in 
  any law of the Parliament of the Commonwealth or of any State.

* (6.)  The powers conferred by this section shall not be construed as being 
  limited in any way by the provisions of section one hundred and five of this 
  Constitution.

## Chapter VIII.—Alteration of the Constitution.

#### 128. Mode of altering the Constitution.

This Constitution shall not be altered except in the following
manner:—

The proposed law for the alteration thereof must be passed by an
absolute majority of each House of the Parliament, and not less than two
nor more than six months after its passage through both Houses the
proposed law shall be submitted in each State and Territory to the electors
qualified to vote for the election of members of the House of Representatives.

But if either House passes any such proposed law by an absolute
majority, and the other House rejects or fails to pass it or passes it
with any amendment to which the first-mentioned House will not agree,
and if after an interval of three months the first-mentioned House in
the same or the next session again passes the proposed law by an
absolute majority with or without any amendment which has been made or
agreed to by the other House, and such other House rejects or fails to
pass it or passes it with any amendment to which the first-mentioned
House will not agree, the Governor‑General may submit the proposed law
as last proposed by the first‑mentioned House, and either with or
without any amendments subsequently agreed to by both Houses, to the
electors in each State and Territory qualified to vote for the election
of the House of Representatives.

When a proposed law is submitted to the electors the vote shall be taken
in such manner as the Parliament prescribes. But until the qualification
of electors of members of the House of Representatives becomes uniform
throughout the Commonwealth, only one-half the electors voting for and
against the proposed law shall be counted in any State in which adult
suffrage prevails.

And if in a majority of the States a majority of the electors voting
approve the proposed law, and if a majority of all the electors voting
also approve the proposed law, it shall be presented to the
Governor‑General for the Queen's assent.

No alteration diminishing the proportionate representation of any State
in either House of the Parliament, or the minimum number of
representatives of a State in the House of Representatives, or
increasing, diminishing, or otherwise altering the limits of the State,
or in any manner affecting the provisions of the Constitution in
relation thereto, shall become law unless the majority of the electors
voting in that State approve the proposed law.
 
In this section, 'Territory' means any territory referred to in section
one hundred and twenty-two of this Constitution in respect of which there
is in force a law allowing its representation in the House of Representatives.
